# Will as a Vector of Becoming

Nietzsche argued that man is not a finished being — but a bridge, not a goal. The will to power is not mere thirst for control, but a deep impulse to **overcome one's current self**.

> “Man is a rope stretched between the beast and the overman.”

The one with true will doesn’t seek applause from the crowd — he seeks **confrontation with reality**.  
In this sense, suffering, isolation, even madness become steps toward transformation.

The overman is not perfect — he is **bolder than all imperfections**.
