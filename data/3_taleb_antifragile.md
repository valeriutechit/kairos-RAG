# Antifragility as Strategy

Nassim Taleb claims: the goal isn’t resilience, but **growth through stress**. The antifragile doesn’t survive chaos — it **evolves through it**.

> “If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.”

Ironically, **real intelligence is not in control, but in dancing with uncertainty**.

A true thinker builds systems that outlive him — and accepts that all things that matter lie outside the comfort zone.

Order is an illusion. Strategy is a dance with chaos.
